This repository contains Kotlin programs demonstrating core concepts and practical applications. Each section covers fundamental topics essential for mastering Kotlin.

## 🛠️ Topics Covered
- **Variables & Data Types**: Understanding Kotlin's type system and variable declarations.
- **Functions**: Defining functions with parameters, return types, and method overloading.
- **Conditional Statements**: Exploring `if-else`, `when`, and other control flow mechanisms.
- **Loops**: Practicing `for`, `while`, `do-while` loops, and forEach for collections.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Classes, objects, constructors, inheritance, and data classes.
